"""Native MXFP4 dense linear kernel for AMD RDNA4 (gfx1200 / gfx1201).

RDNA4 has no hardware microscaling datapath, but an RDNA-enabled
``triton_kernels`` build (the "RDNA graft") provides an in-kernel Triton
dequantizer
(``triton_kernels.tensor_details.layout_details.rdna_value.mxfp4_dequant_rdna``)
that is selected by tagging the weight tensor with ``RDNAMXValueLayout``.
``matmul_ogs`` then unpacks each weight tile to the activation dtype *inside*
the GEMM and feeds it to ``tl.dot`` on WMMA v2, so the 4-bit weights are never
materialized in high precision in VRAM — unlike
``EmulationMxfp4LinearKernel``, which dequantizes the whole weight to bf16 on
every forward.

This kernel is **weight-only (A16)**: activations are consumed at their native
bf16/fp16 precision.  Its numerical oracle is therefore

    F.linear(x, dequant_mxfp4(w, s, x.dtype), bias)

i.e. emulation *without* the activation QDQ that ``EmulationMxfp4LinearKernel``
applies when it is configured with ``kMxfp4Dynamic`` (see the note in
``can_implement``).

Wiring — three edits live outside this file, in
``vllm/model_executor/kernels/linear/__init__.py``:
  1. ``from .mxfp4.rdna import RdnaMxfp4LinearKernel``
  2. insert it into ``_POSSIBLE_MXFP4_KERNELS[PlatformEnum.ROCM]`` **before**
     ``EmulationMxfp4LinearKernel`` (and before ``AiterMxfp4LinearKernel`` is
     harmless — AITER declines on gfx12 today)
  3. add the name to ``__all__``

IMPORTANT — coupling with ``Platform.supports_mx()``:
    This kernel does NOT consult ``current_platform.supports_mx()`` and must
    not start doing so.  Today ``supports_mx()`` means "hardware with NATIVE
    microscaling" (``gfx95`` / ``gfx1250``); gfx1201 is not that — here MXFP4
    is handled by a Triton dequant inside the kernel.  This file gates on
    ``on_rdna4()`` + graft presence precisely to stay independent of that
    predicate.

    If ``supports_mx()`` is ever widened to gfx12, that change and this file
    must land TOGETHER, in the same commit: widening ``supports_mx()`` on its
    own would make ``AiterMxfp4LinearKernel`` claim gfx1201 (its
    ``is_supported`` starts with exactly that predicate) and break the
    emulation fallback that works today.  That same commit must audit the
    other consumers, because several would start claiming native MXFP8,
    which the graft does not provide:
      - ``kernels/linear/mxfp4/aiter.py``
      - ``kernels/linear/mxfp4/emulation.py``
      - ``kernels/linear/mxfp8/rocm_native.py``

# ── Known limitations / TODOs ────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# 1. TODO(rdna-mxfp4) — add an in-tree numerical test.  The original RDNA4
#    patch for vLLM 0.19.x used `RDNAMXValueLayout` ONLY on the MoE path
#    (`_swizzle_mxfp4` -> gpt_oss_triton_kernels_moe); its dense W4A16 path
#    dequantized at load time and called F.linear, so the dense wiring in
#    this file has no prior precedent.  It has been validated on gfx1201
#    layer-by-layer against `F.linear(x, dequant_mxfp4(w, s, x.dtype), bias)`
#    (no activation QDQ), but that validation should live in-tree because of
#    a dangerous failure mode: if the two transposes were ever swapped, the
#    output shape would still be correct for any SQUARE projection (q/k/v/o
#    of a model with uniform head_dim), so NO shape check can catch it —
#    only a numerical test does.  Tolerance: in bf16 exact equality holds at
#    small M; at large M, ~1 ULP differences appear from accumulation order.
#    Use rtol ~1e-2 in bf16, or compare in fp32 with
#    atol = y.abs().max() * 3e-3.
#
# 2. TODO(rdna-mxfp4) — the `matmul_ogs` contract this file assumes
#    (column-major w, logical [K//32, N] scales, explicit RoutingData,
#    `is_persistent=False` in the RDNA4 branch of opt_flags) was verified
#    against one specific triton_kernels revision, not against every build
#    that may expose these symbols.  An upstream change to the order of
#    `w_scale_strides` (today: e, k, n = strides[-3:]) would silently break
#    the scales.
#
# 3. bf16 numerics (why equality with the oracle is expected): the E2M1
#    values (0.5 … 6.0) and E8M0 scales (exact powers of two) are exactly
#    representable in bf16, so the kernel's in-kernel bf16
#    `w_dequant * scale` matches the reference's `(w * scale_fp32).to(bf16)`.
#    Accumulation is fp32 in both cases.
#
# 4. E8M0 edge values (documented, NOT silently "fixed"):
#    `mxfp4_dequant_rdna` converts byte 0x00 to bf16 0.0 and 0xFF to +inf,
#    while the fp32 reference yields 2^-127 and a saturated exponent.  With
#    OUT_DTYPE=fp16 it additionally saturates the exponent to [0, 30], i.e.
#    extreme scales are clamped.  This does not occur in real
#    compressed-tensors checkpoints; if it ever does, it will show up as
#    silent degradation.
#
# 5. Performance: the tuning headroom lives in the RDNA4 branch of the
#    graft's `opt_flags` (block_n, num_stages, split_k for skinny M), NOT
#    here.  Do NOT call `update_opt_flags_constraints` from this file: it is
#    process-global state and would leak into the MoE path.
#
# 6. TODO(rdna-mxfp4) — unverified under cudagraph capture.  The custom op
#    with a `fake_impl` is what the aiter.py precedent requires, but the full
#    path (matmul_ogs + the graft's autotuning inside a captured graph) has
#    not been exercised on RDNA4 hardware.
